Long before the opening of the Lugeck, the brothers Hans and Thomas Figlmüller were interested in the tradition of Viennese tavern culture. 
Old recipe books from their grandmothers were carefully studied and long researches were carried out traditional Austrian cuisine and the countless inns where it was previously served. 
At the end of this research there was the idea of giving the typical Viennese cuisine and the classic tavern culture on or in the Lugeck a new shine.
The guest should feel completely comfortable and transported back to those “good old days” when people spent their free time together at the bar and not in front of the television. 
The Lugeck is considered the new home for all Viennese people who like to eat well and, above all, appreciate a lovingly compiled wine and beer list.
